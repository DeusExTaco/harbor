## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals

- Container discovery: <30 seconds for 100 containers
- Update execution: <90 seconds average
- Memory usage: <256MB for typical home lab
- Test coverage: >95% for core functionality

### Community Goals

- GitHub stars: 1,000+ in first year
- Active contributors: 50+ developers
- Production deployments: 100+ organizations
- Documentation: Comprehensive guides for all use cases

### Quality Standards

- Security: No critical vulnerabilities
- Reliability: >99.9% success rate for updates
- Performance: <5% overhead on system resources
- Compatibility: Support for major architectures (amd64, arm64, armv7)

## Release Cadence

### Version Strategy

- Major releases (X.0.0): Annual, with significant features
- Minor releases (X.Y.0): Quarterly, with enhancements
- Patch releases (X.Y.Z): As needed for security and bugs

### Support Policy

- Latest major version: Full support
- Previous major version: Security updates for 1 year
- Older versions: Community support only

## Contributing Areas

### Immediate Needs (v1.0)

- Testing on diverse environments
- Documentation improvements
- UI/UX refinements
- Performance optimization

### Future Opportunities

- Runtime implementations
- Registry integrations
- Notification channels
- Platform-specific optimizations

### Community Involvement

- Feature requests via GitHub Issues
- Development discussion in GitHub Discussions
- Security reports via security policy
- Documentation contributions welcome

## Design Principles

### Core Values

1. **Privacy First**: No telemetry or usage tracking
2. **Home Lab Friendly**: Zero-configuration deployment
3. **Enterprise Ready**: Scalable architecture
4. **Open Source**: MIT licensed, community-driven

### Technical Decisions

- **Simplicity**: Minimal dependencies, clear architecture
- **Safety**: Comprehensive testing, automatic rollback
- **Performance**: Efficient resource usage, smart caching
- **Flexibility**: Multiple deployment options, extensible design

## Feature Flags

Features are developed behind flags to maintain stability:

- `enable_mfa`: Multi-factor authentication
- `enable_rbac`: Role-based access control
- `enable_kubernetes`: Kubernetes runtime
- `enable_blue_green`: Blue-green deployments

See `app/config/feature_flags.py` for complete list.

## Migration Path

### From Other Tools

- Watchtower: Label-based configuration import
- Ouroboros: Policy migration support
- Diun: Notification configuration import

### Version Upgrades

- Automatic database migrations
- Configuration compatibility
- Backward compatibility for APIs
- Clear upgrade documentation

## Feedback and Iteration

We value community input at every stage:

- Feature prioritization through community voting
- Regular user surveys for pain points
- Performance benchmarking from real deployments
- Security review from community experts

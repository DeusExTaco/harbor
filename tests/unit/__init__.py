"""
Harbor Container Updater - Unit Tests

Unit tests for testing individual components in isolation.
Tests should mock external dependencies and focus on testing
specific functionality of single modules or classes.

Guidelines:
- Test one component at a time
- Mock all external dependencies
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions
- Aim for high code coverage
- Fast execution (< 1 second per test)

Markers:
- @pytest.mark.unit: Mark as unit test
